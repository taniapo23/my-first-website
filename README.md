Hello, I enjoyed discovering new tools such as Bootstrap, different fonts and icons. Playing with CSS is very fun!
The icons droe me mad, the font awesome ones worked for a while and then suddenly did not, I searched other websides but then their position were not fine and despite styling them they were not responding. I have tried to make the search bar working but I could not, the IndexOf option is not available on Javascript, I do not know why and it gives me an error.
I still have some issues with Javascript, I hope with time and practice it will be easier. 

I have definitely learnt how to use Bootstrap and play with it.
